NAME
    RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due tasks

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of RTx::Calendar

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
    reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in
    the menu Search->Calendar.

    There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html)

    You can also enable ics (ICal) feeds for your default calendar and all
    your private searches in Prefs/Calendar.html. Authentication is magic
    number based so that you can give those feeds to other people.

    You can find screenshots on
    http://gaspard.mine.nu/dotclear/index.php?tag/rtx-calendar

INSTALLATION
    If you upgrade from 0.02, see next part before.

    You need to install those three modules :

      * Date::ICal
      * Data::ICal
      * DateTime::Set

    Install it like a standard perl module

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

    If your RT is not in the default path (/opt/rt3) you must set RTHOME
    before doing the Makefile.PL

CONFIGURATION
    To use MyCalendar portlet you must add MyCalendar to $HomepageComponents
    in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm like that :

      Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyCalendar
         MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage)]);

    To enable private searches ICal feeds, you need to give
    CreateSavedSearch and LoadSavedSearch rights to your users.

USAGE
    A small help section is available in /Prefs/Calendar.html

UPGRADE FROM 0.02
    As I've change directory structure, if you upgrade from 0.02 you need to
    delete old files manually. Go in RTHOME/share/html (by default
    /opt/rt3/share/html) and delete those files :

      rm -rf Callbacks/RTx-Calendar
      rm Tools/Calendar.html

    RTx-Calendar may work without this but it's not very clean.

BUGS
    * compatible only with RT 3.6 for the moment. If someone need
    compatibility with 3.4 I can work on this. And I will work on 3.7
    compatibility later.
