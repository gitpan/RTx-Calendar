NAME
    RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due tasks

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of RTx::Calendar

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
    reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in
    the menu Search->Calendar.

    There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html)

    You can also enable ics (ICal) feeds for your default calendar and all
    your private searches in Prefs/Calendar.html. Authentication is magic
    number based so that you can give those feeds to other people.

    You can find screenshots on
    http://gaspard.mine.nu/dotclear/index.php?tag/rtx-calendar

INSTALLATION
    If you upgrade from 0.02, see next part before.

    Install it like a standard perl module

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

    To use MyCalendar portlet you must add MyCalendar to $HomepageComponents
    in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm like that :

      Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyCalendar
         MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage)]);

    To enable private searches ICal feeds, you need to give
    CreateSavedSearch and LoadSavedSearch rights to your users.

ADVANCED USAGE
    If you want to see reminders in a search you need to go in the
    "advanced" tab of the query builder and add something like that :

      AND ( Type = 'ticket' OR Type = 'reminder' )

UPGRADE FROM 0.02
    As I've change directory structure, if you upgrade from 0.02 you need to
    delete old files manually. Go in RTHOME/share/html (by default
    /opt/rt3/share/html) and delete those files :

      rm -rf Callbacks/RTx-Calendar
      rm NoAuth/images/arrow*.png
      rm NoAuth/css/calendar.css
      rm Elements/MyCalendar
      rm Tools/Calendar.html

    RTx-Calendar may work without this but it's not very clean.

BUGS
    * compatible only with RT 3.6 for the moment. If someone need
    compatibility with 3.4 I can work on this. And I will work on 3.7
    compatibility later.
