calendar with your due tickets or due/created tickets and add a
MyCalendar portlet.

Idea borrowed from redmine's calendar (Thanks Jean-Philippe).

Please type "perldoc RTx::Calendar" after installation to see the
module usage information.

* Installation

Install it like a standard perl module

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

To use MyCalendar portlet you must add MyCalendar to
$HomepageComponents in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm like that :

Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyCalendar MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders  RefreshHomepage)]);

And add it your preferences.
